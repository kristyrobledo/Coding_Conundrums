Welcome to Coding Conundrums! 

Coding Conundrums is a monthly informal seminar focusing on increasing efficiency and reproducible research within `R` at the University of Sydney. Each month we focus on a package or workflow with a live demonstration in `R`. 
Code is available on github after each session.
